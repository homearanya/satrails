This fully inclusive 4 night/4 day cycle tour takes you off the main tourist routes, through the quiet country roads of the charming KwaZulu-Natal Midlands countryside. Following carefully selected sections within the Midlands Meander area, this cycle tours combines adventure with some unique cultural “off the bike” experiences such as craft beer and cheese tasting, a guided walk in the mist belt forest, a trip to see some of the most famous San paintings at the Kamberg caves and many other surprises along the way.
