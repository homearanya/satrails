This 3-day gentle slackpack offers a superb combination of pristine wetland birding and lovely walks along along conservancy trails, rich farmland and historic sites. Home to some of the best birding in South Africa, this remote country village has several fine restaurants, charming Anglo Boer period accommodation and an intriguing heritage.

***Day 1 Distance: 10 km (4 hours)***
After a hearty breakfast meet your guide for a 4 hour amble up the historical Boer Wagon trail to the Ossewa Kop Summit.  From here you are awarded with spectacular views of the world-famous wetlands, Zaaihoek lake and the village below. The return is via a steep but contoured rocky descent through the glorious orange florescence of Wakkerstrom Aloes (a fabulous treat for those visiting in spring). 

***Day 2 Distance: 14 km (6 hours)***
Meet up with your Birdlife registered guide for an early morning birding experience.Wakkerstroom is one of South Africa’s top hotspots for birding with rare and endangered pipits, cranes, larks, swifts and swallows to tick off on your ‘must see’ birding list. From here we continue through the wetland to trace the old railway track through farmland up onto a small koppie overlooking the wetlands, an ideal scenic snack spot. We descend into town along a scenic river path. You may also get the chance to spot the playful Cape clawless otter competing for his spot in the limelight.

***Day 3 Distance: 7-12km***
After a light breakfast we meet up with a devoted Wakkerstroom historian for a brief introduction to the village’s illustrious past. Continue on for a historical walk through the town. Visit some of the many national heritage sites such as the Old Court House (famous for its unique architecture), beautiful churches, Victorian houses and an art gallery set in the old bank.
