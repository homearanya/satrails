              Our ecological conscious tours endeavor to live up to the highest
              standards of sustainability. A percentage of the proceeds goes
              towards supporting worthwhile conservation projects in the area
              and we always try choose to use family based eco-friendly
              accommodation places that are involved in conservation or social
              upliftment programs. Most meal are in-season, vegetarian and
              ethically sourced. Where possible, we make use of local guides and
              support sustainable environmental and social initiatives in the
              area. Our tours also offer special 'off the trail' experiences to
              expose people to local history and cultures and a green way of
              living. This experiences include forest walks, tours of a land
              rehabilitation and upliftment programs and excursions to local
              businesses and other community minded initiatives

              Multi-day hiking in South Africa has been on the decline in the
              past decade or so, with fewer hardy hikers prepared to carry
              everything on their backs and sleep out in the open. With the
              aging process comes inevitably sore backs and less energy.  As a
              result many of the traditional long distances hikes have closed
              down

              Luckily, for those of us who love the outdoors, a new concept in
              hiking has arisen, that of slack-packing.  Defined by Fiona
              McIntosh as "hiking without the schlep"  this type of trail is
              made for the hiker who doesn't mind "dirty boots" but prefers to
              hike with basic comforts
          - text: >-
              At the very least on all slack-packing trails, your luggage is
              transported for you from point to point and you are normally
              provided with a packed lunch and meals at the start and end of the
              day with overnight accommodation at suitably chosen lodges. Often
              too you are provided with a guide who can interpret interesting
              features along the way. In other words "you walk at ease and stay
              in comfort"

              Slack-packing strives to improve standards and to make the trails
              accessible to as many people as possible.  Slack-packing is a very
              popular and well established concept in USA, Australasia and
              Europe but is still being developed here in South Africa.  We hope
              to be part of that process in bring South African's wonderful
              wildlife and scenery of our spectacular countryside

              Having cycled the Himalayans, the Silk Road through Turkey and
              many remote parts of South Africa your local tour guide, Julia, 
              believes that there is nothing more gratifying in life than
              exploring our country under your own steam. A KZN Natal girl at
              heart, she is very interested in KZN history and promoting local
              authentic tourism in her own backyard. Whist some may enjoy the
              freedom on cycling self-sufficient with all your luggage on your
              bike, Spekboom bespoke cycle tours recognises the value of
              carefree cycling with luggage transfers, between overnight stays,
              a cold beer , a home cooked meal with a glass of wine and a warm
              bed at the end of each day. 
          - text: >-
              For this reason, all our cycle Tour offer homely accommodation,
              back-up support and delicious meals. Using quite non-technical
              farm roads with very manageable daily distances these tours are
              designed to suit old and young, fit and less fit. The focus of
              each tour is about ‘discovering’ the rich history, wildlife and
              cultural offerings of the KZN Midlands, the Northern KZN
              Battlefields and the Ixopo/Creighton valley.

              One of the big advantages of slack-packing or going on an
              organised tour is that someone else takes care of all the
              logistics. Where to leave your vehicle, transfers to the trail
              head each day and pick-up at the end, places to overnight, what
              food to bring and cook, trail planning and guiding etc are all
              pre-arranged so that you don't have to worry about these matters.

              The main factors you should give consideration to are :  where to
              go, when to go and who to hike/ride with.  There is a growing
              selection of hiking and cycling tours around the country but SA
              Trails focuses particularly on KwaZulu Natal and the Eastern Cape
              with which we are most familiar. New trails are being opened up to
              allow anyone of reasonable fitness level to  enjoy the great
              outdoors.  Daily hiking distances are generally not more than 15km
              or 3-4 hours of comfortable hiking with breaks.  Once you have
              chosen your tour ,then the decision of when to book must be
              made.  
          - text: >-
              Multi-day tours link together a chain of hotels and lodges so all
              be available on the day of arrival for one night stays.  For this
              reason it is often hard to secure accommodation at popular resorts
              during school holidays and  long weekends. To get round this we
              have pre-scheduled tours where accommodation is booked long in
              advance or else we must check availability at the time. 
              Pre-scheduled tours also introduce you to like minded people
              enjoying the same outdoor fun, but if you would rather hike with
              your family and friends then form your own group and we can
              customise a slack-pack hike or cycle ride at time of your
              choosing. Bear in mind though that costs will come down with more
              people in the group so parties of 6 to 10 generally get the best
              rate. Finally, for most outdoor activities in the eastern half of
              South Africa the best time to tour  is during the spring and
              autumn months when temperatures are ideal and there is generally
              less chance of rainstorms and cold weather.

              Paul has been promoting the KZN Drakensberg and Eastern Cape Wild
              Coast as eco-tourism destinations for the past 25 years.  He was
              one of the first pioneers of the concept of “slack-packing”,
              whereby outdoor lovers can hike or cycle on curated trails with
              full back-up support. Hike or ride  in beautiful natural scenery
              while your bags are transferred between lodges with comfortable
              beds and good food and drink at the end of the day.  The Wild
              Coast Walk, Giants Cup Hikeathon and Amphitheatre Heritage hike
              are 3 examples which are now firmly established on the active
              travellers “must-do” list as a result.

              A research biologist by profession, Paul is now retired and living
              with his wife Anne in Hilton KZN.

              He is fortunate to have his 3 grown up daughters living nearby,
              two of which have their own adventure tourism businesses.  An avid
              diver in his youth, Paul now enjoys taking his mountain bike into
              the forests and hills of the Natal Midlands. But is of an age
              where he is now considering e-bike touring as an alternate and
              more gentle pursuit.
