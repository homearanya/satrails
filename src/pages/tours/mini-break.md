shortdescription: >+
  A 3 day 4 night long weekend slackpacking hike on the Wild Coast with pleasant
  daily  walking and overnight  comfort.  Self drive to start hotel or fly into
  East London or Umthata airport on a Thursday and be back home on Sunday with
  all arrangements taken care of eg airport shuttles, full guide service,
  luggage transfers and packed lunches each day.  


  This hike is an affordable alternative for those who want less of a challenge
  and more of an opportunity to get away to nature, to destress,  and soak in
  the wonderful wild coast scenery. We can build in extra rest days or just walk
  through over 2 or 3 days of easy non technical hiking. 


  Hikes depart from Ocean View hotel at Coffee Bay or Morgan Bay hotel on the
  lower Wild Coast.

The **lower Wild Coast Mini-break** hike takes in the last 2 or 3 days of the Sunshine route between Wavecrest and Chintsa.   Fly into East London on a Thursday for the 2 hour shuttle to either Morgan Bay or Seagulls/Trennerys to start your hike the next day.  The hike runs for 15km south to Morgan Bay crossing the Kei River by pont for your second night at Morgan Bay. 

The third day's walk of about 14km takes you to the coastal village of Haga Haga by way of Double Mouth and a string of shelley beaches.  Your last day is a long beach walk of about 16km to the picturesque town of Chintsa where you spend your last night at the elegant Crawfords Beach lodge.

The **Coffee Bay Mini-Break hike** is best suited for guests driving in from KZN, or for those coming from Gauteng,  to fly into Umthata airport for the shuttle down to Coffee Bay.  The hike is centred on the family friendly beach front  Ocean View hotel where you spend your first night.   After breakfast the next day you will take the winding back roads of rural Transkei to the holiday cottages at Presleys Bay from where you start your walk of about 8km to the magnificent surfing beach at Mdumbi river mouth where you stay for 1 (or 2) nights at Swell Eco-Lodge.  The second (or third) day's hike crosses the Umthata river by rowboat and over grassy hills and cliffs to drop down at Coffee  Bay after 10km of pleasant hiking.  After another night at Ocean View you have an option to walk (or drive) to Hole in Wall one of the most scenic and iconic sights on the Wild Coast.
