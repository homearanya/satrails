Cycle touring is catching on fast with new developments in ebikes and touring gravel bikes.

What better place to do this than in the KZN Midlands with its rich diversity of countryside.  Rich farmland and grasslands, extensive network of forest trails and quiet district roads characterise this region.  SA Trails is well placed to design and customise a wide selection of riding routes.  Each ride is unique and planned together with the group for a challenging social cycle while taking time to still enjoy the many scenic attractions along the route.

Scheduled departures on well established routes are planned for the spring and autumn months when the weather is more settled.   Full back up support is given with your overnight packs transported to the next venue and all catering provided.  Form your own group or contact us for details of our next cycle event.
