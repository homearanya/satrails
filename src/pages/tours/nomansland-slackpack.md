    Hiking in the  Southern Drakensberg

Day 1 Arrival
Settle in with drinks and snacks and an optional meander through this charming working cattle ranch. A communal dinner will be served in “The Deli” bistro overlooking a beautiful dam. Listen to historic stories from the area before retiring to your luxury rooms for a good night’s sleep.

Day 2 Distance 20km ( 6-7 hours )
After breakfast in the Deli we set off from the ranch to the Ntsikeni Reserve border. From there we hike through the highest vlei in South Africa (graded 7th RAMSA site in the world) to finish the walk at the community lodge. Enjoy a quiet afternoon birdwatching at the vlei and perhaps recording some 'lifers' the reserve is reknown for. As luggage drop-off is not provided, be sure to pack warm, waterproof clothing for that night and the next day’s hike. 

Day 3 Distance: 20 km ( 8 hours )
An early start as we head to the stunning Rooipoort Waterfall where you can enjoy a refreshing swim in the crystal clear river. Enjoy a well-deserved brunch before the ascent up the mountain. This is a stiff climb, but it is rewarded with magnificent views over the Southern Drakensburg range. That night experience old-word luxury as you bathe in a steel tub of water heated by a donkey boiler! A candlelit dinner of traditional period South African boerekos is the perfect ending to an energetic day.. Please note: Your luggage will be delivered to Guesthouse 1880.

Day 4 Distance: 20 km ( 9 hours )
Today we’ll take a gentle walk through the pastoral landscapes of Belmont Farm eventually making our way back to the first nights’ accommodation at the horse ranch. Dinner will be served in style in the Deli and your last night spent in luxury at the ranch.


Day 5 Departure
After a hearty breakfast it is time to bid farewell for an early departure back home.
