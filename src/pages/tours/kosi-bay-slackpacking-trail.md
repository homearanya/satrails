In the north-eastern reaches of KwaZulu-Natal adjoining the Mozambican border is a unique ecosystem comprising four interconnected lakes which filter into the sea via a sandy estuary. From fern and swamp forests, into mangroves, then grasslands, and up the coastal dune forests; one gets a feeling for the diversity of this special conservancy – the northernmost tip of iSimangaliso’s Wetland Park.

The best way to explore the area is by foot; making your way between the lala palms, cycads and mangroves, and taking to the water for snorkelling in Kosi Mouth. We have a number of slackpacking options which circumnavigate the lakes, and a few that combine the lakes with the pristine beaches down to Banga Nek and Mabibi.

From November to February, the magnificent Loggerhead and Leatherback turtles can be seen coming ashore to lay their eggs, and with advance warning can arrange private guided viewings for interested groups.

Daily hike distances range from 7 – 13km, with overnight stays in comfortable bush and beach camps. Luggage transfers, catering, guiding, snorkeling, and a boat-trip across the 3 lakes, are all included in these tours.
