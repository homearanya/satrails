Immerse yourself in the warm heart of the Eastern Cape’s Wild Coast with this 3 day 4 night hike centred on Ocean View Hotel at Coffee Bay.

Take in the very best of authentic African scenery, from the photogenic Hole in Wall to the golden beaches and secluded estuaries around Presleys Bay.  Walk through the aloe dotted grassy headlands of Lwandile and stretch your legs along long sandy beaches of Mdumbi before crossing Umthata river mouth by rowboat ferry.  Experience the daily lives of the rural Xhosa communities as you walk through the villages and settlements surrounding Coffee Bay and take in the magnificent sunrises and sunsets from the cliffs above your base at Ocean View.

Daily distances are very manageable (less than 10km per day) so you have plenty of time to connect with the magnificent scenery and unspoilt essence of the Wild Coast.  We recommend an extra day at Mdumbi with its world class surfing beach or take a quiet birding paddle up its beautiful lagoon.

Coffee Bay is an easy day’s drive from Durban or East London or a convenient fly in and pick up from Umthata airport if coming from Gauteng. The hike is fully guided with shuttles to the start and luggage transfers included in the package.
