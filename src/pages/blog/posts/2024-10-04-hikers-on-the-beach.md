### ***Wild Coast Crime - Advisory Note***

Please be advised that recent reports have highlighted incidents of criminal activity in the Eastern Cape, primarily linked to organized syndicates and gangs engaged in extortion. While this is a broader challenge across South Africa, the Eastern Cape has become particularly vulnerable due to factors such as limited accessibility, weak cellular communication, and a poorer level of local police capacity. 

However, it is extremely encouraging to note that these developments have prompted a strong response from national law enforcement, with specialized units such as the Hawks and Tactical Response, working alongside private sector investigators to address the issue and allocate necessary resources.

In addition, feedback from our service providers along the Wild Coast indicates that there is robust local support, with communities actively working with camps, hotels, lodges, and guides to ensure the safety and security of all visitors, including tourists. We have also been reassured that hikers along the beaches have not been targeted. Over our 15 years of operation as Wild Trails  we have never encountered any such incidents with our hiking groups.

We fully understand the concerns of our (international) visitors and trust that this information offers greater clarity and reassurance regarding the current situation.

Warm Regards
Sarah, Paul and Julia
