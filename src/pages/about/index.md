              Paul has been promoting the KZN Drakensberg and Eastern Cape Wild
              Coast as eco-tourism destinations for the past 25 years.  He was
              one of the first pioneers of the concept of “slack-packing”,
              whereby outdoor lovers can hike or cycle on curated trails with
              full back-up support. Hike or ride  in beautiful natural scenery
              while your bags are transferred between lodges with comfortable
              beds and good food and drink at the end of the day.  The Wild
              Coast Walk, Giants Cup Hikeathon and Amphitheatre Heritage hike
              are 3 examples which are now firmly established on the active
              travellers “must-do” list as a result.

              A research biologist by profession, Paul is now retired and living
              with his wife Anne in Hilton KZN.

              He is fortunate to have his 3 grown up daughters living nearby,
              two of which have their own adventure tourism businesses.  An avid
              diver in his youth, Paul now enjoys taking his mountain bike into
              the forests and hills of the Natal Midlands. But is of an age
              where he is now considering e-bike touring as an alternate and
              more gentle pursuit.

              Julia is the founding member of Spekboom Tours. Passionate about
              the great outdoors, sustainability and animals she has had a
              diverse career as a veterinary nurse, a teacher and environmental
              facilitator. Most days she can be found burning the trails of the
              Karkloof/Howick forests or helping a local schools set up a
              permacultural garden or library. Spekboom Tours was established as
              an extension of her passions and way of life. After spending many
              happy months backpacking around SE Asia, South America, Europe and
              South Africa, she believes cycle touring is the best way to have
              an authentic experience that will expose people to a culture of
              green living.

              With 75km of spectacular trails in her backyard, it is little
              wonder that she had decided to sink her roots and work from her
              home in the beautiful Midlands town of Howick. If she is a little
              breathless when she answers the phone, you will know why!!
