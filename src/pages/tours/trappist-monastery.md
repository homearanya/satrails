Join us on an extraordinary journey following in the footsteps of the legendary Abbot Francis Pfanner, a charismatic and eccentric religious leader who was instrumental in bringing the Trappist missionary ethos of “work and prayer” to South Africa in the late 19th century. Cycling through the gorgeous countryside in which Alan Paton described as “the fairest valley in Africa”, we visit four magnificent mission stations in 5 days, each one an architectural masterpiece. 

The string of mission stations were established a day’s journey apart, stretching out across the Natal interior from the Monastery at Marianhill. These were established in order that the monks could spend every night under a Trappist roof, while at the same time creating a legacy of beautiful outstations of learning, agriculture and old world spirituality that remain to this day.  

Through the interpretation of local tour guides and resident priests and monks you will learn about the history of the Trappists and their missions on this wonderful pilgrimage. Enjoy the warm hospitality of local country guesthouses with one over-night stay at Centocow Abbey. With back-up support, luggage transfer and very manageable, relatively flat daily distances, this is a fully-guided trip designed for the average cycle tourist who is interested in countryside, architecture, fine food, and the history and settlement of this interesting and scenic part of South Africa.
