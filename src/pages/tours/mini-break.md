shortdescription: >+
  A 3 day 4 night long weekend slackpacking hike on the Wild Coast with pleasant
  daily  walking and overnight  comfort.  Self drive to start hotel or fly into
  East London or Umthata airport on a Thursday and be back home on Sunday with
  all arrangements taken care of eg airport shuttles, full guide service,
  luggage transfers and packed lunches each day.  


  This hike is an affordable alternative for those who want less of a challenge and more of an opportunity to get away to nature, to destress,  and soak in the wonderful wild coast scenery. We can build in extra rest days or just walk through over 2 or 3 days of easy non technical hiking. 


  Hikes depart from Ocean View hotel at Coffee Bay or Morgan Bay hotel on the lower Wild Coast.

The **lower Wild Coast Mini-break** hike takes in the last 2 or 3 days of the Sunshine route from Morgan Bay to Chintsa.   Fly into East London on a Thursday for the 2 hour shuttle to Morgan Bay to start your hike the next day.  

The first day's walk of about 14km takes you to the coastal village of Haga Haga by way of Double Mouth and a string of shelly beaches.  After a comfortable night in the pretty village of Haga Haga you start your next day beach walk of about 16km to Chintsa where you spend your last night at the elegant Crawfords Beach lodge. If you decide on an extra day for the **Adventure Option** we recommend a visit to nearby Inkwenkwezi Game Reserve for a morning game drive or alternately take a short hike down the coast to Yellowsands  where you can pick up a canoe and paddle up the mouth of the Kwelera river for a lunch and pick up at Areena Resort. Return to Crawfords for your last night.

The **Coffee Bay Mini-Break hike** is best suited for guests driving in from KZN, or for those coming from Gauteng.  Option also to fly into Umthata airport for the shuttle down to Coffee Bay.  The hike is based at the family friendly  Ocean View hotel where you spend your first night.   After breakfast the next day you take the winding back roads of rural Transkei to the holiday cottages at Presleys Bay from where you start your walk of about 8km to the magnificent surfing beach at Mdumbi river mouth.  Here you stay in African style rondavels  with catering provided  for 1 (or 2) nights at Swell Eco-Lodge.  The second (or third) day's hike crosses the Umthata river by rowboat and over grassy hills and cliffs to drop down at Coffee  Bay after 10km of pleasant hiking.  After another night at Ocean View you have an option to walk (or drive) to Hole in Wall one of the most scenic and iconic sights on the Wild Coast.  Shuttle back to Umthata if flying out that day, otherwise suggest a last restful night at Ocean View and depart by car the next day
