1. Enchanting Midlands Indigenous Forests

In the heart of a lush mistbelt forest, you are transported to another realm. Indigenous forests are threatened throughout South Africa and sadly are diminishing.  But local conservancies and farmers in the KZN Midlands help to protect mistbelt forests and make them accessible so that others can discover and enjoy their tranquil splendour.



2. Hiking through Nature

We love listening to birdsong, the creaking of trees, the breeze rustling the grasses, the murmur of streams, while breathing in clear air and rich aroma of the forest floor. Midlands forest absorbs the sound of one’s footfalls as one hikes paths frequented by shy creatures such as porcupines, bushbuck and blue duiker.



3. You don’t have to carry a heavy backpack

Slackpacking means your luggage is transported for you.  Carry a small day pack for your padkos and the day's essentials (camera, birdbook etc). 



4. Creature-comforts are not neglected

You can look forward to a hot shower in your cosy accommodation, a home-cooked meal for supper, and a comfy warm bed. 



5. You experience the hospitality of small guesthouses

We make use of farmhouses and guesthouses in the charming Midlands countryside.  Meet the locals and chat around a fire at night while enjoying home cooked food prepared from local suppliers



6. You benefit from the healing power of nature

Studies show that exposure to green spaces helps to moderate our mood and improve our attention span.  The powerful healing power of forests is especially well known.  



7. You contribute to local conservancies and environmental protection

Spekboom Tours donates a percentage of its proceeds to local conservancies and actively raises awareness of and funds for local environmental projects. Such projects include FreeMe KZN’s Blue Duiker Reintroduction Project and the Samango Monkey Research Project in the KZN Midlands, as well as local environmental education programmes.
