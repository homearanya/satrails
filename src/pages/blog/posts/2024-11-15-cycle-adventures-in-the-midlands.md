CYCLE ADVENTURES IN THE KZN MIDLANDS

KwaZulu-Natal’s Midlands Meander is surely one of South Africa’s most successful and diverse tourist routes. 
A pioneer of the concept of local explorations that has been copied in so many other areas of rural South Africa.

Cycle and hiking touring is the best  way to appreciate and savour the people, culture and natural beauty of the KZN Midlands. 

The area stretching from Balgowan to Kamberg was chosen as our location for this inaugural tour with gentle biking meanders along quiet country roads.   But it could have been equally anywhere else on the Meander which stretches from Hilton to Estcourt and inland as far as the Southern Drakensberg.

Riders arrived for their first night farm-stay accommodation in the historic village of Rosetta. 
No opportunity though to flake and retire early as wine tasting was on the menu at the specialist wine shop.

The brisk winter air next morning chilled and excited the riders for their ride through rolling farmland.
First stretch was through the[ Usher Crane Conservancy](https://kzncranefoundation.org.za/about-kzn-cf/) dedicated to rehabilitating blue and wattled cranes, which are some of South Africa’s most critically-endangered birds.

There followed a gentle downhill ride through cool, forested backroads to arrive for a welcome 'regmaker' at the [Balgowan Brewery](https://www.balgowanbrewery.co.za/). This small brewery was started by a young, enthusiastic couple who are typical of many entrepreneurs in the Midlands implementing their dream projects.

After some more earnest testing and tasting, it was time to re-alight velocipedes and point them in the direction of lunch. This was at the historic Caversham Mill, overlooking the Lions River.

The overnight stop was in the beautifully-restored historical Lemonwood cottages in the Dargle Valley. That night, the group was entertained by a typically South African celebrity performer[,  Lara Kirsten,](https://laraafrika.blogspot.com/p/about.html) who entertained us with exquisite classical piano music combined with her own passionate English and Afrikaans poetry.

The third day started with a 6km walk in the Lemonwood mist forest, then a ride to [Bramleigh Manor](https://www.bramleigh.co.za/) farm near Fort Nottingham through a patchwork of picturesque farms and green dairy country. 

Another dynamic young couple here, Kaitlynn and Andre Kauerauf, have turned a conventional bed-and-breakfast establishment into an exemplar of an ethical and nature-attuned farm-accommodation establishment.

The farm tour included explanations of the use of regenerative biodynamic principles (no pesticides, fertilisers or growth enhancers) so that farm animals grow slowly, naturally and seasonally.

In the morning the brave cyclists faced the long 35km ride ride through the Kamberg Reserve  to Highmoor and the Kamberg caves. After a well earned rest break we walked another 4 km to the Game Pass Shelter cave, so named because it lies along the former migratory route of antelope.

The final night was at [Glengarry ](https://glengarry.co.za/)a traditional Midlands family-run resort with trout fishing lakes and more recently added hiking and cycle tracks in the foothills of the berg.

Next morning, participants tired from the cycling of the past few days,  pointed their steeds towards Rosetta to collect their cars.  For those with less time restrictions a stock up of local sourced products and lunch at the Rosetta Hotel concluded a memorable few days in the magnificent Natal Midlands.
