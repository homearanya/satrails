Using a comfortable farmstay as a base, this hike comprises of two circular 12-15km hikes. The first day’s hike takes you through natural forest and across farmland to arrive at a cascade of water falls situated on a private permaculture farm. Guests will be treated to a locally grown picnic lunch served by our friendly hosts and landowner before returning to their farmstay that afternoon. On the second day’s hike, guests will be transferred 10km up the road to the start of the iNhlosane ridge at the trail-head. From here they will slowly ascend the ridge using a well-marked indigenous tree trail through Boschberg Reserve up onto the saddle of the iNhlosane Mountain. From here there are a few rocky and steep inclines across the highlands grassland which in Spring and Summer is swathed in a blanket of beautifully delicate wild flowers. Once at the summit on the ridge at the trig beacon 1800 m this marks the highest point in the Midlands, hikers will then follow the relatively flat ridge with an extensive bird’s eye view of Midlands farmlands and coursing rivers on either side below. The hikers can look forward to reaching the head of the iNhlosane Mountain at the head of the ridge. From here they will be rewarded with stunning view of the Midlands which on a clear day one can see as far as the sea. From here it is a short walk through indigenous forest back to the farmstay for an afternoon departure.
