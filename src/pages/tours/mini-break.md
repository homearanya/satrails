shortdescription: >+
  A 3 day 3 night long weekend slackpacking hike on the Wild Coast with pleasant
  daily  walking and overnight  comfort.  Self drive to start hotel or fly into
  East London or Umthata airport on a Thursday and be back home on Sunday with
  all arrangements taken care of eg airport shuttles, full guide service,
  luggage transfers and packed lunches each day.  


  This hike is an affordable alternative for those who want less of a challenge and more of an opportunity to get away to nature, to destress,  and soak in the wonderful wild coast scenery. We can build in extra rest days or additional activities if requested (eg local history and nature tours, river cruises or paddling, bush camps with game drives etc)

The **lower Wild Coast Mini-break** hike takes in the last 2 or 3 days of the Sunshine route from Morgan Bay to Chintsa.   Fly into East London on a Thursday for the 2 hour shuttle to Morgan Bay to start your hike the next day.  

The first day's walk of about 14km takes you to the coastal village of Haga Haga by way of Double Mouth and a string of shelly beaches.  After a comfortable night in the pretty village of Haga Haga you start your next day beach walk of about 16km to Chintsa where you spend your last night at the elegant Crawfords Beach lodge. If you decide on an extra day for the **Adventure Option** we recommend a visit to nearby Inkwenkwezi Game Reserve for a morning game drive or alternately take a short hike down the coast to Yellowsands  where you can pick up a canoe and paddle up the mouth of the Kwelera river for a lunch and pick up at Areena Resort. Return to Crawfords for your last night.
